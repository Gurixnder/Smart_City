# Smart_City
Smart City implemented using Raspberry Pi.

The applications implemented in Smart City are mentioned below:
  # Flame detection
    -This system uses a fire detection sensor and the system consists of a buzzer to alert the residents of the city. 
    -When the flame is detected, the data is sent t the dashboard and is used to alert the fire department of the city.
  # Smart Garbage disposal
    - Uses an ultrasonic sesnor installed on the inner side of the garbage can lid.
    - When the garbage fills up to certain height, an email is sent to the garbage department to collect it.
    - It is only used in case of businesses that produce a lot of waste.
  # Smart Parking
    - Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect a vehicle present in a parking spot.
    - The data is sent to the dashboard and the position of parking lot is marked as available or unavailable.
    - The sensor takes reading on a regular basis, to give an accurate status.
  # Tempearture and humidity
    - Uses a dht sensor to measure temperature and humidity.
    - The data is sent to dashboard where it is displayed on a grpah.
    - Using data generated from AI, a prediction of the temperature and humidity is made.
  # Traffic Lights
    - These traffic light are controlled using a motion sensor
