# Smart_City
Smart City implemented using Raspberry Pi. 
The Goal of this sytem is to create a sustainable, enrgy and time efficient city which puts its residents first and improves the quality of their lives.

The applications implemented in Smart City are mentioned below:
  # Flame detection
    -This system uses a fire detection sensor and the system consists of a buzzer to alert the residents of the city. 
    -When the flame is detected, the data is sent t the dashboard and is used to alert the fire department of the city.
  # Smart Garbage disposal
    - Uses an ultrasonic sesnor installed on the inner side of the garbage can lid.
    - When the garbage fills up to certain height, an email is sent to the garbage department to collect it.
    - It is only used in case of businesses that produce a lot of waste.
  # Smart Parking
    - Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect a vehicle present in a parking spot.
    - The data is sent to the dashboard and the position of parking lot is marked as available or unavailable.
    - The sensor takes reading on a regular basis, to give an accurate status.
  # Tempearture and humidity
    - Uses a dht sensor to measure temperature and humidity.
    - The data is sent to dashboard where it is displayed on a grpah.
    - Using data generated from AI, a prediction of the temperature and humidity is made.
  # Traffic Lights
    - These traffic light are controlled using a PIR motion sensor that detects motion of things with body heat only.
    - It is installed in school zones based on school timings to aid students cross without pressing buttons. And as soon as they all cross and
      no body heat is detected, the traffic light turns green.
  # Smart street lights
    - Use PIR sensor to detect the body heat of a pedestrian walking on a street.
    - Strretlights only work when soomeone's present on the streets.
